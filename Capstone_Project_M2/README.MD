## Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb listings in Bangkok to understand pricing, guest preferences, host behavior, and market competitiveness. It is part of a Capstone Project (Module 2).

## Objectives
- Explore nightly price distribution and identify competitive ranges.  
- Analyze room type preferences by district.  
- Measure popularity through review counts.  
- Assess the effect of `availability_365` on occupancy and pricing.  
- Compare individual vs multi-listing host performance.  
- Evaluate the impact of minimum night policies.  

## Dataset
- Cleaned Airbnb Bangkok dataset (`.xlsx`)  
- Key columns: `price`, `room_type`, `neighbourhood`, `number_of_reviews`, `availability_365`, `minimum_nights`, `host_id`.

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and exploratory analysis with Python.  
- Visualizations with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau.  
- Insights translated into actionable recommendations.  

## Outcomes
- Identified competitive price ranges per district.  
- Entire home/apt is the most preferred room type.  
- Review counts correlate with popularity.  
- Multi-hosts dominate reviews but pricing is similar to single hosts.  
- Strict minimum night policies reduce booking potential.  

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook)  
- Tableau Public (interactive dashboards)  
- Excel (data preprocessing)
